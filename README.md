# Copy-Images-From-SD
I shoot raw+jpg and like keeping everything organized and backed up.
I was tired of copy thing manually. So I've created a small windows application ( using C# , .NET 4.61) to help me copy files from SD ( or camera via USB) to my local repository.

I would love to hear your feedback.

The idea is
*you point to the source folder ( SD card or any folder)
*point to the destination folder .
* Check which file types should be copy ( Video for now is only mp4 files )
* press copy and it will copy only the files types you checked ( New folder for each type) by date ( new folder for each date)
